<h1>Personal information</h1>
<p>My name is Brandon Nguyen, I am 19 years old, and my ethnicity is Vietnamese. I was born in Australia in 2003 and lived in the western side of Australia. I am currently studying information technology bachelor in RMIT University. My characteristic is out-going, friendly, and humorous. I feel most satisfied when people are entertained along with me. My passion is learning more about the Japanese culture because I admire their country’s lifestyle and tradition. My goal is to go to Japan in the future and attempt to move there with a full-time job as a programmer or developer. I want to experience a different lifestyle and learn in a new environment. My hobbies are gaming, listening to music, watching anime, programming, and piano. I’ve recently only started to learn some programming languages such as python and java. I’m not particular good at piano as I was never taught how to read notes. I usually learn off YouTube tutorials and copy the movements of tiles to learn a song. I enjoy gaming as it has helped distract me from negative situations and events. I listen to music in almost everyday activities whether it’s studying, working out, and doing chores. Music has helped calm me in situations and given me motivation. </p>
