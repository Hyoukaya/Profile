<h1>Personal information</h1>
<p> My name is Brandon Nguyen, I am 19 years old, and my ethnicity is Vietnamese. I was born in Australia in 2003 and lived in the western side of Australia. I am currently studying information technology bachelor in RMIT University. My characteristic is out-going, friendly, and humorous. I feel most satisfied when people are entertained along with me. My passion is learning more about the Japanese culture because I admire their country’s lifestyle and tradition. My goal is to go to Japan in the future and attempt to move there with a full-time job as a programmer or developer. I want to experience a different lifestyle and learn in a new environment. My hobbies are gaming, listening to music, watching anime, programming, and piano. I’ve recently only started to learn some programming languages such as python and java. I’m not particular good at piano as I was never taught how to read notes. I usually learn off YouTube tutorials and copy the movements of tiles to learn a song. I enjoy gaming as it has helped distract me from negative situations and events. I listen to music in almost everyday activities whether it’s studying, working out, and doing chores. Music has helped calm me in situations and given me motivation. </p>

<h1>Your interest in IT</h1>
<p>Within the IT group, I’ve always shown a strong interest in the programming aspects of the world of IT. I’ve seen many things developed by coding that seemed unnatural and impractical, but it inspired me to have a keen interest in programming and its various languages. I saw the infinite creativity you can have with the ability to code and how much it has helped our society. I want to have a similar kind of impact with the knowledge to code and create things I’ve always wanted to try. My interest in IT started when I had a MacBook in Year 6 during primary school. I developed an attraction towards technology and learned various basic knowledge about computer devices. As I progressed in learning about technology, I discovered coding and had eager to learn more about it.
<br><br>
I was inspired by a famous content creator on YouTube, Michael Reeves as he made the most absurd projects with his talented programming skills. This gave me the motivation that anything can be created with programming with enough effort and creativity. My first development of coding was a website I made in high school, and I was awarded a certificate for the highest score on the assessment. I was taught visual basics during high school and attempted to learn python during my spare time. My experience in programming is beginner’s level. The reason I choose RMIT university is because they have strong guidance in the department of technology, and I wanted to learn more about programming and IT by applying to this course. My goals and achievement during this course are to learn as much as possible about IT to expand and advance my skills and knowledge about programming and technology. I hope to achieve a professional standard of IT knowledge by the time I graduate with a degree.

<br><br>
The skills I currently possess aren’t enough to meet the requirements for the position. As I lacked programming and the qualification that is strongly desired for the position. Although, I can present strong team leadership and cooperative skills that can be resourceful to group tasks. My skills in problem-solving are inadequate in a real work environment because I lack experience. Although, I strongly believe that I can improve my problem-solving skills over time within the environment. I am able to quickly adapt and learn to various work conditions. A skill I am proud of is the ability to type very fast on a keyboard as I can express fast pace working conditions.
How I will achieve the required skills for the position is to develop a study plan to learn coding 5 times a week while studying at university. I will spend 1-2 hours of coding per day and develop mini projects to polish my skills. Ask questions and crave to learn from other experienced programmers to produce my own coding fundamentals. My setback is I am not studying computer science but I plan on working at a company with enough experience to meet the requirements for the position for this company. Otherwise, I will apply to learn computer science at university. </p>
<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>I am viewed as a thoughtful and idealist toward the people around me. I attempt to set a positive impact on other people and strive to guide friends and families to grow into their best selves. I am a natural leader and have the charisma to inspire people. I am contended that I have the ability to provide comfort and inspiration to people. I don’t view myself with strong leadership skills, but I do my best to provide a strong sense of responsibility to those around me. It is true that I show a lot of care for others and do my best to help them improve. Although, I don’t continuously pressure my beliefs and advice on others because I don’t want to condition them under a stressful state. Rather, I find myself wanting to take things slowly and constantly reassure them about the positives.
<br><br>
I believed having these traits will be a great approach to many work environments and opportunities as I can help people feel more comfortable and open toward me. Having a subtle perspective from others will help me socialise within the team fluently and complete tasks responsibly. If it is required for me to initiate leadership within the team, I will intervene and attempt my best to keep the team members on the right track towards completing a dire task.
<br><br>
Before, attempting to form a team I will gain everyone’s trust and acknowledgment that I am viewed reliably. I want to present a strong impression that I can provide the team with a productive and successful working environment. If I were ever to come across a difficulty, I will create solutions and possible outcomes to ease the stressful scenarios for every member. I don’t want to express an assertive attitude unless it is needed by another member. I want to have a friendly and impactful team that is willing to provide benefits for everyone else within the group.</p>
<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>A project I would develop is a fast-paced horror game that conditions the user to be under immense stress while trying to complete tasks to advance to the next level. While the user is completing the tasks daunting ambient sounds will be played randomly indicating danger to the user. The goal of the user is to complete every task successfully without failing and finish all levels. If the user fails a task they are immediately disqualified and presented with a horrifying punishment. I’ve always enjoyed horror theme genre because I thrive on the tension and adrenaline from feeling afraid of abnormal events. I believe I can create an entertaining and terrifying game with experiences from movies and other video games.
<br><br>
My motivation to concentrate my time developing this game is the knowledge I can gain from learning a programming language. I contend to carefully study how other people develop their games with intermediate-level skills and implement their code into my own. Or research in depth about the code I need to operate my program. Horror games are deemed to be a consistent subgenre in gaming and have made responsive sales from consumers.  The best-sold horror game is Resident Evil 7 biohazard with its beautiful and immersive graphics that create a realistic simulation. The game is presented in first-person which creates more anticipation and realism when playing.
<br><br>
The plan for the production of the game is to create a top-down perspective view as it gives the user more movement. The setting of the environment will be a typical abandoned mansion in a dark theme time zone. Within the building, a player is required to complete various tasks to advance to the next room. Every task will become more difficult at each level while having a lurking presence gazing at them. The task will consist of simple and common-sense activities that require the user to either memorize patterns, guide through a maze, spot the difference or clean the room. While attempting to complete the task, ominous noises will be played at random to frighten the player and pressure them to act hastily. The player will have an unknown awareness of when the enemy will attack if any of these conditions are to occur the game will end and the player will lose. To avoid the enemy from attacking the player must memorise every room he enters and while completing the task he must check the room for anomalies. If the player successfully spots the anomaly, he is protected from being attacked by the enemy. If the player fails to notice any anomaly the enemy will attack, and the game will end. The player’s character vision will be weakened forcing them to explore the room cautiously and avoid being attacked by the enemy while searching for the anomaly.
<br><br>
I plan to create 5-10 rooms for the user to navigate through to finish the game. Each room has a different theme and I want to relate the theme to Japanese horror mythology. I always enjoyed Japanese mythology and I believe it’s a significant idea to include traditional stories. Each enemy will have the role of a Japanese mythology creature. How I will design the model of my character is a default male or female character that is presented as a standard option. The character will have a cone shape vision similar to a flashlight and forcing the user to have a more cautious experience. The character has the movement keys to interact and navigate up, down, left, and right. Whenever the player discovers an anomaly, they must interact to remove or alert the anomaly. Once it is alerted the enemy won’t disturb the player and they must continue completing the task. I will program the room to reveal anomalies at random while the player's screen is occupied with the tasks. The only method to notice there is an anomaly is when ominous sounds begin to play indicating that there is a change within the room. As the sound becomes more constant and louder this notifies that the player is at risk of facing danger. If the player insists to discover the danger they will be punished and the game will end. Each room proceeding will have its difficulty level increase and have a higher chance of facing immediate danger. The longer the player stays in the same room completing the task the faster the enemy will strike. This pressures the player needing to complete the task quickly to avoid the punishment.
<br><br>
The software I will use is either Unity, Visual Studios, Godot Engine, or Unreal Engine. This software is beginner friendly and I can learn to code effectively with the current skills I possess. Research and source I will rely on consistently are Youtube, Google, and GitHub. Any code I use from other sources will be recreated to benefit my project and I will prevent any plagiarism in my program. I will be asking for help from advanced programmers to teach me useful codes for my project. The hardware I will use to create my project is a personal computer at home.
<br><br>
The skills required for this project is an understanding of the C++ programming language to develop the game. I will use tutorials and guides from online sources to provide me with enough knowledge to develop the game at a standard level. The software Unity and Unreal engine have beginner-friendly guidance for inexperienced users, and I can adapt quickly to the software’s essentials. How I will design the components and characters is using Aseprite a pixel art drawing and animation. The software does not require experienced users to operate the software as it is mainly used for drawing. All the development will be produced on my personal computer at home. The software will require a powerful device to process all the entities.
<br><br>
The outcome I expected from the project is to develop and enhance my skills as a programmer while developing a game entertaining enough for the audience. If the project is made successful and shown entertaining to the audience. I will have confidence in my ability to code and continue to strengthen my skills in the program. If the project does not meet the expectations, I will reflect on what I could have done better and work harder towards becoming an efficient programmer. The impact of this development will grow my ability to code and gain skills from unfamiliar software.
