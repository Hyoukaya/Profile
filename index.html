<h1>Personal information</h1>
<p> My name is Brandon Nguyen, I am 19 years old, and my ethnicity is Vietnamese. I was born in Australia in 2003 and lived in the western side of Australia. I am currently studying information technology bachelor in RMIT University. My characteristic is out-going, friendly, and humorous. I feel most satisfied when people are entertained along with me. My passion is learning more about the Japanese culture because I admire their country’s lifestyle and tradition. My goal is to go to Japan in the future and attempt to move there with a full-time job as a programmer or developer. I want to experience a different lifestyle and learn in a new environment. My hobbies are gaming, listening to music, watching anime, programming, and piano. I’ve recently only started to learn some programming languages such as python and java. I’m not particular good at piano as I was never taught how to read notes. I usually learn off YouTube tutorials and copy the movements of tiles to learn a song. I enjoy gaming as it has helped distract me from negative situations and events. I listen to music in almost everyday activities whether it’s studying, working out, and doing chores. Music has helped calm me in situations and given me motivation. </p>

<h1>Your interest in IT</h1>
</p>Within the IT group I’ve always shown strong interest towards the programming aspects in the world of IT. I’ve seen many things developed by coding that seemed unnatural and impractical, but it inspired me to have a keen interest in programming and its various languages. I saw the infinite creativity you can have with the ability to code and how much it has helped our society. I want to have a similar kind of impact with the knowledge to code and create things I’ve always wanted to try. My interest in IT started when I had a MacBook in Year 6 during primary school. I developed an attraction towards technology and learnt various basic knowledge about a computer device. As I progressed learning about technology, I discovered coding and had an eager to learn more about it.

I was inspired by a famous content creator on YouTube, Michael Reeves as he made the most absurd projects with his talented programming skills. This gave me motivation that anything can be created with programming with enough effort and creativity. My first development of coding was a website I made in high school, and I was awarded a certificate for the highest score for the assessment. I was taught visual basic during high school and attempted to learn python during my spare time. My experience of programming is beginner’s level. The reason I choose RMIT university because they have a strong guidance in the department of technology, and I wanted to learn more about programming and IT by applying to this course. My goals and achievement during this course are to learn as much as possible about the IT to expand and advance my skills and knowledge about programing and technology. I hope to achieve professional standard of IT knowledge by the time I graduate with a degree.
